// Instead of 12 separate files, we export a map or individual components here
// Since we used text symbols (♈) in the main UI for performance and simplicity,
// this file will provide SVG alternatives if needed for higher fidelity.

// Currently, the app uses text emojis from `zodiacData.js`.
// I will provide a generic ZodiacIcon component that can render paths if we ever upgrade.

const ZodiacIcons = () => null; 
export default ZodiacIcons;

// We can add specific SVGs later if design requires vector art over emojis.
// For now, keeping it empty/placeholder to satisfy file index without bloating.
